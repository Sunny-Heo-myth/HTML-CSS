        The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system
        where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
        (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks,
        and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred
        via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software
        application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called
        a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated
        the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.
